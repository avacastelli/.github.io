    <h1>Meringues with Cocoa Powder</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This beautiful light white cloud-shaped dessert, with an outside crust that 
    will crack as soon as you bite into giving way to a crisp inside. Sugar heaven 
    for your senses.Those classic meringues only call for 2 ingredients to make, but 
    they can be a bit of a challenge to make.  I added a touch of cocoa powder to the 
    egg white at the last minute to give it that touch of chocolate flavor. Optional 
    of course.One of the biggest challenges is the weather. Humidity can affect them. 
    One of the greatest nemesis if I may add, as they will not stay crunchy and fluffy, 
    but become rather chewy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>    
            <li>4 egg whites</li>
            <li>7 ounces caster sugar</li>    
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>  
        </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven at 280F.</li>
            <li>Place the egg whites in a very clean mixing bowl. Whisk at medium-high
             speed until the whites begin to froth. Add the sugar one spoonful at the 
             time while whisking at high speed. Egg white will become glossy and begin 
             to form stiff peaks.</li>
             <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spoon the mixture on it 
                 at an even distance. Set in the middle of the oven and bake for 50 minutes. 
                 Then turn the oven off and leave the meringues in the oven, without opening 
                 the door for another hour.</li>
            <li>Place the meringues on a plate and dust with cocoa powder before serving.</li>
